# TabTerminator
This script is meant to  open tabs on a laptop.
Within the OpenTab folder exists 3 different implementations of python that each take the name and domain extension of a website as user input and opens it. Currently, the user must have the correct domain extention in order to be sent to the correct site. Future work may be done to redirect users to a google search in the case that the domain extension is unknown.
